Our goal is to find what combination of variables can be used to make some sense out 
of this data, or to see if any of these variables have any meaningful impact. Since the 
data is about students, gpa may be a key variable that drives the relevance of the other 
variables. The preceding image depicts scatter plots that show that a greater number 
of female students have a higher gpa than the male students and a greater number of 
male students spend more time on computer and get a similar gpa range of values. 
Although all scatter plots are being shown here, the intent is to find out which data 
plays a more significant role, and what sense can we make out of this data.
